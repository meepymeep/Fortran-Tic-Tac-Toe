  ! Pre-coding meep: I guarantee this will be painful considering
  ! some of the weird things printing in Fortran can do.

  ! Row one
  print *, board(1), " | ", board(2), "| ", board(3)
  print *, "--|--|--"

  ! Row two
  print *, board(4), " | ", board(5), "| ", board(6)

  ! Last row
  print *, board(7), " | ", board(8), "| ", board(9)

  ! Post-coding meep: It actually wasn't surprisingly!
  ! It worked flawlessly when finished!
