# Fortran-Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game made entirely in Fortran, honestly very fun to make! I think Fortran will become my new language of choice.
  - (warning i've found a few bugs i'm not fixing right now cause i spent quite a bit on this)

# How to play for those out there
If you want the "best" experience, play with two people. You and a friend, your dad, mom, dog.. I don't care.

- You choose a letter (wow)
  - The person who chose their letter is "Player"
  - The one who didn't is "Player2"
  
- You pick a number from 1 - 9 to get your letter on the board.
# Enjoy :)
  - oh yeah btw i forgot to comment my code once i finished the board rendering subroutine
